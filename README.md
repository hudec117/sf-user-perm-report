## Q&A

**Q**: What does "Session expired or invalid"/"INVALID_SESSION_ID" mean?

**A**: This is because your session has timed out and you've been logged out of Salesforce, please log back in and refresh the page.

<br />

**Q**: Is this extension available on Edge/Firefox/Safari?

**A**: I plan on making the extension available on the latest Edge and Firefox versions. I do not have a Mac so I'm not planning for Safari support.
